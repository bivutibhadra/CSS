<h1>cow</h1>
<p>Cows are 4-legged animals that are herbivorous. </br>
    They feed on plants. They are big animals that can reach a height of 3-4 feet.</br>
     We get plenty of food products from cows like milk, cheese, yogurt, fat, etc.</br>
     They are mammals who give birth to young ones. </br>
     The babies of cows are known as calves.</br>
     There are many varieties of cows; some of them have</br>
     white, plain skin, while others have a spotted body. </br>
     Most of the cows have thick coats that are 4-layers deep. </br>
     Cows are of great importance to man. We are dependent on them for</br>
     plenty of products without which we cannot imagine our lives.</p>
