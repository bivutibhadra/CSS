<p>
    Cows are 4-legged animals that are herbivorous. They feed on plants. They are big animals that can reach a height of 3-4 feet. We get plenty of food products from cows like milk, cheese, yogurt, fat, etc. They are mammals who give birth to young ones. The babies of cows are known as calves. There are many varieties of cows; some of them have white, plain skin, while others have a spotted body. Most of the cows have thick coats that are 4-layers deep. Cows are of great importance to man. We are dependent on them for plenty of products without which we cannot imagine our lives.
